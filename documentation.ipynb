    "# What is MERRA-2?\n",
    "The MERRA-2 dataset provided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center covers a wide range of reanalysis weather data for the whole globe.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides data beginning in 1980. It was introduced to replace the original MERRA dataset because of the advances made in the assimilation system that enable assimilation of modern hyperspectral radiance and microwave observations, along with GPS-Radio Occultation datasets. It also uses NASA ozone observations after 2005. Additional advances in both the GEOS-5 model and the GSI assimilation system are included in MERRA-2. Spatial resolution remains about the same (about 50 km in the latitudinal direction) as in MERRA.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Along with the enhancements in the meteorological assimilation, MERRA-2 takes some significant steps towards GMAO’s target of an Earth System reanalysis. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate space-based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions with other physical processes in the climate system. MERRA-2 includes a representation of ice sheets over (say) Greenland and Antarctica.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">*(taken from http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "MERRA-2 offers **51 different datasets** with hundreds of weather parameters. They usually come in the **NetCDF dataformat**, an open binary format primarily used in climate and geosciences. _\"NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.\"_ ([Source](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)) NetCFD files can be understood as a multidimensional list file – i.e.  something like a collection of individual lists in one file. Due to the number of variables in one dataset and the vast number of geo points a file of one dataset for a single day can be as big as several hundred MB in size.\n",

    "- It is freely available and accessible.\n",
    "- It provides worldwide weather data.\n",
    "- Its data goes back to 1980 and is constantly updated (monthly with a delay of approx. 3 weeks).\n",
    "- It provides wind & temperature data in six different heights and thus allows for the creation of height profiles.\n",
    "- It provides hourly values (even though they are calculated down from 3-hour-data).\n",
    "- It has a worldwide resolution of 0.625° by 0.5°.\n",
    "- It uses the OPeNDAP standard (see below) which makes data access easier.\n",
    "- It has a huge international community.\n",

    "\n",
    "OPenDAP stands for “Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol”. It is a HTTP-based standard protocol for data transmission designed specifically for science data. OPeNDAP is based on Data Access Protocol DAP (currently Version 2.0, Aug 2011). The standard has been developed by NASA scientists (DAP is a \"NASA Community standard\"). OPenDAP provides data types to accommodate gridded data, relational data, and time series and also allows users to define their own data types. Standards for encapsulating structured data, annotating the data with attributes and adding semantics that describe the data are also included. This includes subsetting capabilities that allow easy data access.\n",

    "# OPSD's approach to weather data\n",
    "**Weather data differ significantly from the other data types** used resp. provided by OPSD in that the sheer size of the data packages greatly exceeds OPSD's capacity to host them in a similar way as feed-in timeseries, power plant data etc. While the other data packages also offer a complete one-klick download of the bundled data packages with all relevant data this is impossible for weather datasets like MERRA-2 due to their size (variety of variables, very long timespan, huge geographical coverage etc.). It would make no sense to mirror the data from the NASA servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we choose to provide \"only\" a **documented methodological script** (as a kind of tutorial) that allows to download and filter specific datasets, parameters, geographical areas and timeframes and export them in an easily readable format like CSV. The following method describes one way to automatically obtain the desired weather data from the MERRA-2 database and aims to simplify resp. unify the above mentioned manual methods in a single script. The use of MERRA-2 is only exemplary - through the use of the OPenDAP interface it can be adapted to other datasets using the same protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is tailored to the needs of energy system modellers that a) do not want to downlad and haggle with the original MERRA-2 data manually, and those who on the other side b) do not just want to take over ready-made feed-ins calculated by tools like [renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) but rather want to use their own feed-in tools with processed weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the structure of NASA's use of the OPeNDAP standard (namely the system of filenames and locations etc.) has **changed frequently** over the last months. Unfortunately we are not always able to keep the script up-to-date to all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solar Radiation\n",
    "Unfortunately, the MERRA-2 dataset does not offer variables for the direct and indirect radiation, which is necessary for the calculation of the PV-feed in. Thus we have to apply a method to calculate the direct and indirect radiation from the given parameters in MERRA-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods to divide global into (in)direct radiation\n",
    "There are different approaches to the division of global radiation. A 2010 [Master Thesis](csold.unibe.ch/students/theses/msc/34.pdf) by F. Lanini (University of Bern) gives a good overview and evaluation of different decomposition models (p. 32 ff.) Most methods applied in models are based on the method by Reindl et al. (D.T. Reindl, W.A. Beckman, and J.A. Duffie. Diffuse fraction correlations. _Solar Energy_, 45(1):1 – 7, 1990.) The method we use for OPSD is implemented in a Renewable Energy Atlas by Anders. A. Sondergaard (within the Project \"Optimization of the future power systems’ main RE sources – wind and sun\" at Aarhus University in 2013) and documented below.\n",
